## Data Steps

### Fetch Data

- Get Comma-separated values (csv) file everyday containing values about the Basic Attention Token cryptocurrency from the **yfinance** module (Yahoo Finance, https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BAT-CAD/history). The data is ranged between the day BAT was published until the day the file is downloaded.  

### Pre-process Data

- Removed non-informative columns and Not Available data rows.  

- Scaled Open and Close values with a MinMax Scaler.  


### Data Exploration

- Plot of open and close values per day (for the last 30 days).  

- Plot of highest and lowest values per day (for the last 30 days).  

- Plot of the volume values per day (for the last 30 days).  

- Plot of the close value from last year until today.
